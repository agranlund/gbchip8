1.0     WHAT IS CHIP8?
---	--------------
Err, acctually I don't really know myself, it's a very old computer/videogame
I guess. There are interpreters for most computers to run CHIP8 games.
It was popular on the HP-calclators once so there's a lot of
freeware games for it :-)

CHIP8 spec.
-----------
Resolution:	64 * 32 pixels
Sound:		Yes, single tone beeper
Colours:	Black & white
Controller:	16 Button (hex) keyboard
Speed:		????
Graphics:	"sprites" always XOR'ed against the background

There's also something called the SUPER-CHIP8. The S-CHIP8 has better resolution
and a few more commands...
Both the CHIP8 and the SUPER-CHIP8 is fully emulated in this emulator!


S-CHIP8 spec.
-------------
Resolution:	128 * 64 pixels
Sound:		Yes, single tone beeper
Colours:	Black & white
controller:	16 Button (hex) keyboard
Speed:		????
Graphics:	"sprites" always XOR'ed against the background
		Vertical scrolling (down) 1-16 pixels at a time
		Horizontal scrolling (left/right) 4 pixels at a time

1.1	WHAT IS GB-CHIP8?
---	-----------------
GB-CHIP8 is an emulator that allows you to play CHIP8 and SUPER-CHIP8 games on
your Gameboy or Gameboy-emulator (see 2.0 for details of how to use it).
Everything on the CHIP8/SCHIP8 is emulated so all games *should* work fine.
The emulator is written in assembler (TASM with Jeff Frohwein's Gameboy table)
and will emulate the CHIP8 in full speed.. The SCHIP8 game could be slower
than the original in some games.

The source code for the emulator is included and you are free to modify it
for your own purpouse. You are however *not* allowed to spread modified copies
of it on the internet or elsewhere.

The source is unfortually not richly commented as I didn't plan to release the
source, but there are some comments and they are in English...

Enjoy!



2.0	HOW TO USE CHIP8 GAMES WITH THE EMULATOR
---	----------------------------------------
There's two ways of using the GB-Chip8 interpreter:
"single-game" or "multi-game" mode.

SINGLE-GAME: 	Only one CHIP8 game on the gameboy-cart
MULTI-GAME:	Up to 11 games on one gameboy cart (composed by CHIPMENU.EXE)


2.1	SINGLE-GAME MODE
---	----------------
Instructions on how to use a single chip8-game togheter with the emulator:

The file GBCHIP8.DAT is the emulator-program, you need to "merge" this file
with the chip8-game.

example (In DOS):
copy /B GBCHIP8.DAT /B + [chip8 game] GBCHIP8.GB

This will create a new file called GBCHIP8.GB containing the emulator
and your chip8-game.

WARNING: You *must* use a program like RGBFIX or similar to pad the
	 "GBCHIP8.GB" into 64Kb and also correct the checksum in order
	 to be able to run this on a real Gameboy!!



2.2	MULTI GAME MODE
---	---------------
You need to run CHIPMENU.EXE (only avaliably for MS-Dos) to create a mult-game
cart.


example for CHIPMENU:

CHIPMENU.EXE [game1] [game2] [game4] ..... [game11]

This will create a file called GBCHIP8.GB that's ready to be runned on your
Gameboy / Gameboy-emulator.

( The program will look for RGBFIX.EXE in order to automaticly correct the
checksum, if it can't find it you *must* correct it somehow before you
can run it on the real gameboy! )



3.0	MENUS
---	-----

3.1	MAIN MENU
---	---------
When running the cart you will see a menu looking like this:

LOAD GAME		- Run a chip8 game
CONFIGURE JOYPAD	- Set the joypad settings
OPTIONS			- options menu
ABOUT			- some info...

Multicart:
----------
Pressing the LOAD-GAME menu will bring you up to a menu of all the games
you chosed with GAMEMENU. Pressing on a name will start the game!

Single cart:
------------
Pressing LOAD-GAME will run the game that is on the cart.


When running the emulator:
If you press both [SELECT] and [START] at the same time will bring you
back to the "LOAD GAME" menu.



3.2	JOYSTICK CONFIGURATION
---	----------------------

This screen looks like this:


	 UP:    ?
1 2 3 C  DOWN:
	 LEFT:
4 5 6 D  RIGHT:

7 8 9 E  A:
	 B:
A 0 B F	 START:
	 SELECT:

   ^       ^
   |       |---  This is the Gameboy buttons
   |
   |
   |
   |--- The Chip8 16-button keyboard



Since the chip8 uses 16-buttons and the gameboy has only 8, you won't be 
able to control all of the chip8-buttons with the emulator.
And as different games uses different button-settings you will need
to change the joypad settings for almost every game you play.

You will be prompted to select what the gameboy buttons should be mapped
as on the chip8 keyboard.

Pressing [SELECT] will abort, and send you to another screen:
multi-game:  MAIN MENU
single-game: Resets the chip8 and starts it over



3.3	OPTIONS MENU
---	------------
SOUND 		- Turn the sound ON/OFF
COLLISSIONS	- Turn the collission detection ON/OFF
FORCE SCHIP	- Force all the games to run in Super Chip mode
CHIP8 DELAY	- Set speed for Chip8 games (0 = fastest, 250 = slowest)
DONE		- Go back to the main menu


3.4	RUNTIME
---	-------
Buttons to press during game:


[START] + [SELECT]
multigame:	You go back to the LOAD GAME menu
singlegame:	You will go to the joystick config. screen

[A] + [B] + [START] + [SELECT]
This resets the Gameboy

7.0	HISTORY:
---	--------
(Fourth official release v0.6)
98-04-16	* GB-Chip8 is discontinued... All games seems to work ok, so
		  there's no need to work on it longer.
		  Also. I doub't anyone uses this as the feedback is *very*
		  low, in fact only one person has given me any feedback at all.
		* This release will probably be the final and comes with full
		  sourcecode in TASM format.

98-04-07	* The emulator now automaticly skips the HP48 header if there is 
		  one, no need to convert the games from the HP48 format before
		  running it with the emulator.
		* Made the 4*5 fonts a bit nicer..

98-04-06	* Fixed a bug when resetting the Gameboy in single-game mode
		* ALL games that has been tested so far works OK!!

98-04-06	* Fixed bug in random-number command.. Made a couple of games
		  work! (WORM3, puzzle, puzzle15 etc..)

		  8x10 character set...
		* Added a new menu: "OPTIONS", with options for setting
		  sound and collisions ON/OFF and also "force s-chip" for
		  forcing the emulator to always use the super-chip.
		* MAJOR speedup in sprite drawings!!!
		  The emulator is now acctually too fast as the games becomes
		  unplayable :-) Need to implement a slowdown routine...

98-04-03	* Super-Chip games now runs!
		* Scrolling works in all directions... (slow)
		* Removed bug in 16x16 sprites drawing

(First Official release v0.3)

		* Sound is fully emulated
		* Made a nicer looking play-screen.
		* Collision detection is implemented
		* Fixed a bug when loading/storeing the registers, finally
		  got the space-invaders scroller working and blinky works
		  now also!!
		* 16x16 sprites 'might' work now..

		* ~90% of the opcodes emulated and seems to be working
		  fine.
		* 8xN sized sprites is beeing drawn (not yet perfect)
		* Built in fonts are emulated.
		* The 16x16 sprite is not yet implemented.
		* Timing is emulated... Seems close enough.
		* Very lousy keypad emulation.
		* Sprite collisions not yet implemented.
		* No random number routines yet.
